# Intro
This is just some random calculations I commonly use day to day in one place

* Dish Pointer Link
* Add in Easting / Northing / Lat / Long bearings between two points, from up / down, then from True North (CW) and for CAD (CCW)
* Add in Watt / Amp / Volts calculations
* Add in Three Phase power factor

## Some references
* 150g rice + 300g water = 350g cooked rice
* Rice cooker = 145g
* Rice cooker + lids = 160g
